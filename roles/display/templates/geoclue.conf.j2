# URL to a WiFi geolocation service compatible with the Ichnaea API
# (https://ichnaea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/geolocate.html).
# An API key can be set by using the 'key' URL parameter.

# To use the Google geolocation service, uncomment this URL
# while changing YOUR_KEY to your Google API key.

# Submit data to WiFi geolocation service
# If set to true, geoclue will automatically submit network data
# each time it gets a GPS lock.
#
# Currently, only Modem-GPS or Network NMEA sources are supported as providers
# of a location to submit (one at a time).
# If Modem-GPS source is enabled above it will be the exclusive provider
# (regardless whether the system is actually equipped with such modem),
# otherwise Network NMEA source will be considered.

# Compass configuration options
[compass]

# Enable Compass

# Static source configuration options
#
# This source reads location from "geolocation" file in @sysconfdir@ - please
# consult geoclue(5) man page for the format description of this file.
[static-source]

# Enable the static source
# If you make use of this source, you probably should disable other location
# sources in this file so they won't override the configured static location.
enable=true

# Application configuration options
#
# NOTE: Having an entry here for an application with allowed=true means that
#       geoclue will not ask agent to authorize the application. This is to
#       ensure that applications with built-in authorization mechanism (e.g web
#       browsers) do not have to be bound to agents.
#
#       If your application is denied access to location information and your
#       operating system doesn't provide any mechanism to change that, it is
#       likely a bug in your operation system (or geoclue). The solution is to
#       report the issue with all details, rather than adding your application
#       to this list.
#
# Format:
#
# # Desktop ID of application without .desktop part
# [random-app]
#
# # Allowed access to location information?
# allowed=true|false
#
# # Is application a system component?
# system=true|false
#
# # List of UIDs of all users for which this application is allowed location
# # info access, separate by ';'. Keep it empty for allowing it for all users.
